        "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It's trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on many consumer GPUs.\n",

Therefore, it is challenging to train these models and also use them for inference."
